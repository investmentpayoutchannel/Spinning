The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to an error with the `npm run build` command. The error message indicates that npm is unable to find the `package.json` file in the `/opt/build/repo` directory, leading to the `npm error code ENOENT`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `package.json` file is present in the root directory of your project.
2. Ensure that the `package.json` file is correctly committed to your repository.
3. If the `package.json` file is present in your repository but still not found during the build, check for any possible issues with the file path or permissions.
4. Double-check your build script to make sure it is referencing the correct path to the `package.json` file. If needed, update the script to provide the correct path.
5. If the `package.json` file is part of your repository but still not being detected, consider checking the build configuration to ensure it is not excluding certain files from the build context. If so, adjust the configuration accordingly.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue causing the build failure related to the `package.json` file not being found during the build process.
